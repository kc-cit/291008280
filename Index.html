        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>I am passionate about learning new technologies and exploring fields like <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> and <strong>Data Science</strong>. These areas fascinate me because they are at the core of modern computing, data protection, and analysis.</p>

        <p>One of the topics I’ve particularly enjoyed is learning about <strong>binary numbers</strong>. It’s amazing how the entire digital world—from computers to the internet—is built on just two states: 1s and 0s!</p>
